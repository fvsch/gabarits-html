# HTML and CSS layout templates

This is a series of HTML and CSS layouts that I originally created for a video course on HTML and CSS back in 2008, then updated in 2024 using modern layout techniques (including Flexbox, CSS Grid, and mobile-first responsive styles).

All content beyond this README is in French.

## 2024 version

The `2024` folder contains updated layouts. Youâ€™ll notice that while the code itself is updated to use modern layout techniques, the overall design patterns used are a bit dated. Creating a multi-column layout and putting most content in the central column was all the rage in the mid-2000s, but by the 2010s the trend was to slice a web page into 5 to 20 big full-width sections, each with its own dedicated layout.

So you could say this version is 2006 layout trends with 2020 coding techniques (mostly CSS Grid).

## 2008 version

The `2008` folder contains the original layouts created in 2008 with techniques compatible with Internet Explorer 6. There is a lot of `float` and `position: absolute`, some fixed widths, and some repeating background images to simulate equal-height columns. None of those layouts are responsive.

The 2008 version is shown here as a historical artefact. Please use the 2024 version if you want to base a design on these layouts.
